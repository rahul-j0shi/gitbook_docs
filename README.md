# Offers

This guide dives into the new experience of Offer Management in Enveu Experience Cloud.

This guide covers two types of offers:

1. Subscription offers
2. Video on-demand/PPE offers.

Subscription offers bundle a group of product ops and services into one price.

Video On-demand/PPE offers, on the other hand, allow customers to access and watch specific content by making a one-time payment or transaction.
