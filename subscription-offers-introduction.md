# Subscription Offers: Introduction

This guide explains the concept of subscription offers. Subscription offers represent a business model where customers agree to pay a recurring fee to access a product or service. This fee is automatically charged at the end of a billing cycle, which could be weekly, monthly, annually, or quarterly. Major OTT platforms like Netflix, Disney, Hotstar, and Prime typically use this recurring fee model.
